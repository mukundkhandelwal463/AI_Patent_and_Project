🧠 Project Overview
The Smart Inkless Pen is an innovative writing tool that digitizes handwritten content in real-time without ink, paper, or touchscreens. Powered by optical tracking, gesture recognition, and AI-based handwriting recognition, this eco-friendly solution transforms handwriting into digital text instantly and syncs across devices via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

🎯 Objectives
To create a surface-independent, ink-free, and eco-friendly smart pen.

To enhance learning, creativity, and professional tasks with a portable digital writing tool.

To integrate AI-based handwriting recognition for real-time storage, search, and sync of notes.

🧩 Key Features
Inkless & Paperless Writing: Write on any surface without consumables.

AI Handwriting Recognition: Converts handwriting into editable digital text.

Gesture Controls: Switch modes or erase content with hand movements.

Cross-Device Syncing: Real-time syncing to apps like OneNote, Google Keep, Notion.

Portable & Rechargeable: Sustainable design with long battery life.

🧪 Technological Components
Accelerometer & Gyroscope – Detect hand movements and orientation.
